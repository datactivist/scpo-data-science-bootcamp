# How do you make a citizen-led food database ?

class: inverse, center, top


## Easy, just crowdsource</br>the data !

### But what does it mean exactly ?]

## 1. Defining input format

---

### "What you see is what you get"

First difficulty : as a citizen-led project, Open Food Facts should be accessible to anyone willing to contribute. Hence, the required data must be easy to find. As easy as **back-of-pack** food labelling is.

Off Food Facts maps its categories on the food labelling :

![](./img/off_prince_lu.png)

---

### No prior knowledge

.pull-left[To stay as accessible as possible, OFF sticks to the labels : no transformation or interpretation of the data is required.

The database wiki offers guidance on the way to fill the data fields : how to name packaging shapes ? How to spell product's name ?

But, most of the time, the advices goes :

> The best way to fill it is to enter the value as indicated on the product. Don't forget the units!
]

.pull-right[Data fields as listed in [the OFF Wiki](https://wiki.openfoodfacts.org/Data_fields) :

![](./img/off_datafields.png)
]

---

### A food data conondrum : labels

One specific issue with food products is the endless variety of labels and mentions they can be tagged with.

Apart from their basic meaning, the scope is too wide to sort in an ordered fashion : from agricultural method used to diet compatibility or ecological impact, the diversity of themes is multiplied by the languages and countries they are distributed in.

OFF's choice on this matter is, yet again, based on accessibility : one open field to gather labels and a ridiculously long list of the known ones to structure a taxonomy ([16606 labels in different languages to date](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-server/blob/main/taxonomies/labels.txt)).

![](./img/off_labels.png)

---

### Automated data fields

.pull-left[#### Metadata

Every entry in the database should be documented by itself : to follow the evolution of the database, it must contain the information on who modified what and when.

Those data are called **metadata** as they document the data itself. Those entries are always automated and can't be modified manually as they ensure the integrity of the database (and the tracability of the modification, as we'll see in part 3).
]

.pull-right[#### Calculated fields

Some data *can* be automated based on input data from the community and most of the time *is* (as it can be missing frmo the package) :

### Bulk and fresh :</br>OFF's dead angle

.footnote[As OFF focuses on packaged product, bulk and fresh food products and beverages are absent from the database.]

## 2. Gathering contributions

---

### The OFF technologie(s)

OpenFoodFacts is made of [several layers of software](https://wiki.openfoodfacts.org/Software_Development) dedicated to each part of the project :

* **the database** itself (Perl and MongoDB) ;
* the website (HTML5, JS, Foundation)
* the various phone apps (Swift, Java) ;
* the data processing features (machine learning, annotation, etc.) ;
* the software developpment kits for external reuse ;
* etc.

All of which is open source, freely available and open to contribution [on Github](https://github.com/openfoodfacts).

The tool used to allow contribution is MediaWiki, widely known as the *"Wikipedia interface"*.

### But you all have already contributed to Wikipedia, right ?

### ... right ?

---

### How Wikipedia works

At the top-right corner of each product page, a **Edit the page** button allows anyone to access the editing interface :

![](./img/off_edit_the_page.png)

---

#### Editing a product page

.pull-left[
.center[
![](./img/off_editing_interface.png)
]
]

.pull-right[Once you identified yourself with an OFF account, you access the **editing interface** consisting in the list of the data fields with each variable open to editing :

* **free field variables** you can complete with simple text ;
* **drop down menues** when possible values are limited (such as units) ;
* **upload fields** to add pictures of the product and its label.

Each field can be documented in a specific language.

Examples are given to help contribution.
]

---

### OFF's API

.pull-left[
Contributing through the wiki can be a hastle (especially when walking down supermarket isles).

The OFF projects allowed other apps to contribute to the project in their own interface by making available an application programming interface, or **API**. This programs works as an intermediate between the OFF database and external apps.

In practice, the API is a two-way-door :

* as an **entry point** it can receive data from the outside ;
* as an **exit point** it can make data available from the inside.
]

.pull-right[The best know app for contributing via your phone, we already mentionned, is Yuka.

But there's [a wide array of reuses through the OFF API](https://wiki.openfoodfacts.org/Reuses_of_Open_Food_Facts) :

* [fraise ou bacon](https://www.fraiseoubacon.com/) : an app taking your dietary preferences and food urges into account to give Nutri-Score rated recipes ;
* [c'est meballé près de chez vous](https://cestemballepresdechezvous.fr/) : to find locally packaged products ;
* [Allergobox](https://www.allergobox.com/) : to help you find food products compatible with you allergies ;
* etc.
